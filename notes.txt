Difference between git fetch and git pull

command : git fetch
git fetch downloads commits, files, and references from a remote repository (such as origin) to your local repository.
It does not modify your working directory or merge any changes into your local branches.
It only updates your remote-tracking branches (e.g., origin/main), allowing you to see the changes made on the remote repository.

command : git pull
git pull is a combination of git fetch followed by either git merge or git rebase.
It downloads the changes from the remote repository (like git fetch) and immediately integrates those changes into your current branch.
By default, git pull performs a git fetch followed by a git merge.
